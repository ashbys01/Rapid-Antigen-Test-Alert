# Rapid-Antigen-Test-Alert
A script to scrape the https://findarat.com.au/ site to alert via Pushover if a test is available in your list of suburbs
<h1>Dependencies</h1>
- chrome driver executable in your PATH variable
- Python3 with Selenium installed

<h1>Usage</h1>
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/firejoust/rta_booking_information_discord
Set your working directory to the repo

cd rta_booking_information_discord
Copy and modify the sample settings file

cp settings_sample.json settings.json
Firstly, acquire a discord bot token from https://discord.com/developers. Change the license details & family name. if you already have a booking, set the flag to true. If you leave the centres null all centres will be searched. Wait timer is how long the script will wait for the site to load. Refresh timer is how often (after scraping timeslots) that the script should restart.

Run the script (for bash based systems e.g. mac/linux/WSL)

./scrape_availability.py
Run the script (for windows)

python3 scrape_availability.py
After the script is running, you must send a message to your discord bot to determine the correct message channel:

$register
The process can be gracefully stopped with the following command:

$stop
This has been tested to work in my system but there are numerous edge cases where this might fail.

Your account status is different to mine
RTA changes website.
RTA IT team blocks your IP
The website is very slow
If the website is slow and the script fails at selecting the driving test on a new booking try increasing the wait_timer.

Disclaimer:
For personal use only.
Dont break the law or cause disruption using this.
Using automated scripts irresponsibily can cause booking loss, disruption of services etc. be careful and know what you are doing.
